Currently a perl web developer, but have also had jobs in RF hardware
engineering, FPGA software defined radios, embedded linux hardware and
software design, low-level C/C++ embedded design (without OS or light
RTOS) and just generally interested in all the cool new and old stuff.
I've also spent some regrettable time doing work on Windows CE
devices.
